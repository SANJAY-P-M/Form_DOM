# Course Enrollment - Day Two Task: Creating a Form

## Task Description


**Objective**: The primary goal for today is to design and create an HTML form that can be used to collect user information.

**Requirements**:

1. Create an HTML form with fields to collect the following information:
   - Name
   - Department
   - Sports (with radio buttons for selecting a sports option)
   - Languages (with checkboxes for selecting multiple languages)

2. When the user clicks the "Submit" button, an alert should display all the information entered into the form.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. **Set up Your Environment**: Ensure you have a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text) and a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) installed on your computer.

2. **Create a New HTML File**: Start by creating a new HTML file in your code editor. You can name it something like `form.html`.

3. **HTML Structure**: Build the basic structure of your HTML document by including the necessary HTML tags, such as `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, and `<form>`. Remember to include a `<label>` for each form field to provide context.

4. **Form Fields**: Add the form fields listed in the requirements section.

5. **Submit Button**: Create a "Submit" button for users to click when they've entered their information.

6. **JavaScript Function**: You may choose to add a JavaScript function to handle the form submission and display the collected information in an alert when the "Submit" button is clicked.

7. **Testing**: Test your form in a web browser to ensure it looks and works as intended. Fill out the form and submit it to see if the data is collected correctly.

8. **Documentation**: Document any special features or choices you made during the design and development of your form. This can be helpful for your own reference and for anyone reviewing your work.

## Submission

Once you've completed the form and are satisfied with your design, you can submit your work according to the course guidelines. If you have any questions or need help along the way, don't hesitate to reach out to your instructor or fellow students.

Good luck, and happy designing!
